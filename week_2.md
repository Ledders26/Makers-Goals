# Week 2 goals, notes and mini-diary!

## Weeks goals:

### As set out by Makers in the weekly outline:

* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

### My own goals

* Try to complete/use more of the resources/additional work set out in the week outline document
* Complete the week 1 dice app (https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/main/test_driven_development/TDD_process.md)

## Day 1:

### Goals for today

**Replace my use of allow with double**
Following on from the meeting with John, he used double, which I'd not used this weekend but want to understand (I instead used allow).  To test this, I will update my airport_challenge code with a double, and test it works

**Read more about code reviews**
After the code review this morning, I felt quite unprepared for it, so I want to better understand them.  To achieve this I will thoroughly ready the notes John supplied and do any additional reading required.  This hopefully will help me better review them next week, after which I'll ask for some feedback

### Summary

Intro to code reviews and a kick-off for the afternoon challenge, which is based on Oyster Cards.  Then afternoon working on that

### General Notes:

Have decided to amend a few things about my daily calendar - add some goals (as set in my peer group chat every day), add some weekly goals and have a section at the start of the week for the weekend challenge.  The reason I'm adding my goals at the start, is often they are quite different from the "What do I want to do tomorrow" section, based either on what comes out of a training session, peer group meetings etc.

Had a good day, enjoyed learning about code review, though feel it's something a fair bit of work is needed on (and a better general understanding of coding!).  The coding in the afternoon, it felt a bit like going over some old ground from last week and the weekend...though did learn a few things (see below)

### Did I have fun?

Not as much as I'd hoped.  I started the day with a lot of enthusiasm and energy, but felt it wained a bit in the afternoon.  I think after the buzz of the weekend challenge, and the end of last week, it felt like I didn't learn as much today as I'd expected

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes - just about :) - I've practiced some coding review, I've also learnt a little about creating Gemfiles and also about using the change match for rspec tests, which reduces a lot of hard coding

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

Enjoy it more (learn more!)
Spend some time looking into code reviews (will add to Outstanding Goals, as if I don't get time tomorrow, it's something I want to know by next Monday's review!)

### Have I completed today's goals?

1/2 - I went back and replaced allow with double, re-ran rspec and it worked as before!
I have added code review as an ongoing goals

## Day 2:

### Goals for today

**Update my daily github repo**
I didn't do it last night, as I normally do, and don't want to fall behind.  Quite easy to determine the success of this!

**Watch the airport challenge YouTube video**
Probably be my goal for a few days, but want to make a start watching it and see what I can learn from it.  I'll take notes along the way for any learns, which I can use as evidence of completing this goal

### Summary

No lessons today, but spent some time with peer group and then working on goals.

### General Notes:

Started watching the exemplar on the weekend challenge, which I will watch the rest of.  Already has given me some hints and tips on how to improve my TDD.  The afternoon I worked with Eddie.  Had a great session together and made quite a lot of progress, learning a lot on the way

### Did I have fun?

Yes, lots!

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes - learnt more from the exemplar, and in the pair coding I learnt a lot more about mocking, and Eddie helped me understand a few different methods to write rspec tests

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

Continue watching the rest of the exemplar
Provide some feedback for Chloe (as she has sent me a request)

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes, I have started watching the exemplar video and updated my goals (as you can see!)

## Day 3:

### Goals for today

None set today in peer chat :() - was a full days programme but I will endeavour to always set goals on future mornings
Send some feedback to Chloe (as per yesterdays goals)

### Summary

After our peer catchup we had a Feedback session with Dana, then our first Process workshop, where I worked with Victoria, followed by a brief pairing session with Charlotte

### General Notes:

The Process workshop was very enlightening, watching someone who is 4 weeks ahead, learnt some process tips and good to see how they use TDD after more practice.  

### Did I have fun?

Yes - enjoyed all three sessions

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, though large part of the day more about feedback, though I suppose this feeds into being better at most jobs including programmer!  But the session with Victoria I feel helped me improve my TDD skills

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

Set goals!
Watch exemplar video
Look at double process - think it makes more sense now, but want to enforce it

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes, in that I sent Chloe some feedback.  But didn't set enough goals

## Day 4:

### Goals for today

**Better Understand mocks/doubles**
Improve understanding, what I'm not entirely clear on is why, outside of the example of last weekends airport challenge, using it to mock a random(ish) event (in that case their being a storm, which I gave a 1/20 chance), doubles etc would be used.

**Watch more of the exemplar video for the airport challenge**
As it says on the tin really!

### Summary

In the morning we had a Domain Modelling workshop, at the end of which John went through doubles/mocking after a request from the cohort.  Afternoon was spend pairing with Kathleen

### General Notes:

Domain modelling was interesting to see, and nice to understand how we come up with a plan for classes etc.  Was very happy John ran through mocking. There were a lot of questions, but for me the main thing was getting more used to the syntax, but more crucially why.  I had understod what they did, but only understood their use to step in for a non-standard response (ie a user input, a random event etc), but John explained you do it for unit testing to keep tests within a unit and make them non-reliant on a seperate class.  Inter-class testing is covered by Functional testing.  This means, if something breaks in class A, it won't break the tests for class B, which is still working as before.

Also very much enjoyed pairing with Kathleen - although her schedule seems tough being dialled in from Australia!  By the time we finished around 5:30pm it was 4:30am for her!

### Did I have fun?

Yes, very much, especially learning more about doubles and coding with Kathleen, we got on very well

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes - as mentioned about doubles/mocks...but also the modelling is good to understand and finally the challenge today moved on to splitting a class, which was interesting and made me practice large chunks of what has been learnt in the first nearly two weeks (!!)

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Watch more of the exemplar - still finding it a help.
* Eddie asked for some help with the Class splitting step - have offered to help as, aside from liking Eddie and enjoying working with him, it might help solidify it in my mind!
* Work on the weekend challenge tomorrow

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes - as detailed understand mocks/doubles now, and watched another 30 mins of the exemplar

## Day 5:

### Goals for today

**Watch more of the exemplar**
As I've had for a couple of days, not setting myself the goal of finishing, but I'm wanting to watch a bit more each day.  I'm making notes on anything learnt in order to monitor my progress on this

**Work on the weekend challenge**
As it's Friday it's time to break the back of the weekend challenge!  Don't expect to finish it tonight, but would like to get to a point of knowing what I want to do and cleared over 50% of the user stories

### Summary

As there were no workshops, the morning was a few catch ups, Peer Group, JL Group and spent 30 mins with Eddie (see y'days "what do I want to do tomorrow") - the 30 mins with Eddie we learnt a lot and realised parts of the challenge I'd missed, so once catch ups done spent some time on the Oystercard challenge and did more of a split of the Classes.

Afternoon I coded with Ed - we had a good session cracking on with some more of the Boris Bikes challenge

Evening - time to start the weekend challenge!

### General Notes:

Made some more progress with the Boris Bikes challenge, which we enjoyed and the retro's are always a nice way to round up the week

### Did I have fun?

Yes, good day!

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes I think so - myself and Ed went back over the splitting of the Class and think it drilled home some of what I've learnt over the previous day or two

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

I'll focus on that Monday as it's the weekend, but plan is to make as much progress with the weekend challenge as possible

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes - by the end of Friday night/Sat morning I'd made a good start on weekend challenge and had found time for another 20 mins of the exemplar

### Did I achieve the weekly goals?

Yes, though I found the splitting of classes very tricky, though I feel it's something we'll come back to as the course goes on.
