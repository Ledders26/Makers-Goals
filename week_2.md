# Week 1 goals, notes and mini-diary!

## Weeks goals:

### As set out by Makers in the weekly outline:

* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

### My own goals

* Try to complete/use more of the resources/additional work set out in the week outline document
* Complete the week 1 dice app (https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/main/test_driven_development/TDD_process.md)

## Day 1:

### Goals for today

**Replace my use of allow with double**
Following on from the meeting with John, he used double, which I'd not used this weekend but want to understand (I instead used allow).  To test this, I will update my airport_challenge code with a double, and test it works

**Read more about code reviews**
After the code review this morning, I felt quite unprepared for it, so I want to better understand them.  To achieve this I will thoroughly ready the notes John supplied and do any additional reading required.  This hopefully will help me better review them next week, after which I'll ask for some feedback

### Summary

Intro to code reviews and a kick-off for the afternoon challenge, which is based on Oyster Cards.  Then afternoon working on that

### General Notes:

Have decided to amend a few things about my daily calendar - add some goals (as set in my peer group chat every day), add some weekly goals and have a section at the start of the week for the weekend challenge.  The reason I'm adding my goals at the start, is often they are quite different from the "What do I want to do tomorrow" section, based either on what comes out of a training session, peer group meetings etc.

Had a good day, enjoyed learning about code review, though feel it's something a fair bit of work is needed on (and a better general understanding of coding!).  The coding in the afternoon, it felt a bit like going over some old ground from last week and the weekend...though did learn a few things (see below)

### Did I have fun?

Not as much as I'd hoped.  I started the day with a lot of enthusiasm and energy, but felt it wained a bit in the afternoon.  I think after the buzz of the weekend challenge, and the end of last week, it felt like I didn't learn as much today as I'd expected

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes - just about :) - I've practiced some coding review, I've also learnt a little about creating Gemfiles and also about using the change match for rspec tests, which reduces a lot of hard coding

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

Enjoy it more (learn more!)
Spend some time looking into code reviews (will add to Outstanding Goals, as if I don't get time tomorrow, it's something I want to know by next Monday's review!)

### Have I completed today's goals?

1/2 - I went back and replaced allow with double, re-ran rspec and it worked as before!
I have added code review as an ongoing goals

## Day 2:

### Goals for today

**Update my daily github repo**
I didn't do it last night, as I normally do, and don't want to fall behind.  Quite easy to determine the success of this!

**Watch the airport challenge YouTube video**
Probably be my goal for a few days, but want to make a start watching it and see what I can learn from it.  I'll take notes along the way for any learns, which I can use as evidence of completing this goal

### Summary

No lessons today, but spent some time with peer group and then working on goals.

### General Notes:

Started watching the exemplar on the weekend challenge, which I will watch the rest of.  Already has given me some hints and tips on how to improve my TDD.  The afternoon I worked with Eddie.  Had a great session together and made quite a lot of progress, learning a lot on the way

### Did I have fun?

Yes, lots!

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes - learnt more from the exemplar, and in the pair coding I learnt a lot more about mocking, and Eddie helped me understand a few different methods to write rspec tests

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

Continue watching the rest of the exemplar
Provide some feedback for Chloe (as she has sent me a request)

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes, I have started watching the exemplar video and updated my goals (as you can see!)

## Day 3:

### Goals for today

None set today in peer chat :() - was a full days programme but I will endeavour to always set goals on future mornings
Send some feedback to Chloe (as per yesterdays goals)

### Summary

After our peer catchup we had a Feedback session with Dana, then our first Process workshop, where I worked with Victoria, followed by a brief pairing session with Charlotte

### General Notes:

The Process workshop was very enlightening, watching someone who is 4 weeks ahead, learnt some process tips and good to see how they use TDD after more practice.  

### Did I have fun?

Yes - enjoyed all three sessions

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, though large part of the day more about feedback, though I suppose this feeds into being better at most jobs including programmer!  But the session with Victoria I feel helped me improve my TDD skills

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

Set goals!
Watch exemplar video
Look at double process - think it makes more sense now, but want to enforce it

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes, in that I sent Chloe some feedback.  But didn't set enough goals
