# Week 4 goals, notes and mini-diary!

## Weeks goals:

### As set out by Makers in the weekly outline:

* Build a simple web app with a database
* Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
* Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables)

### My own goals

* Watch an exemplar for the weekend challenge
* Try and complete more of the workshop/example learning provided in the week outline
* Add a review of the goals from last week!

### How did I do with last weeks goals?

Good, I feel I can answer all the Makers questions, and made some good progress towards mine...and got Twilio working and sending me texts!

## Day 1:

### Goals for today

**Find exemplar for this weekends challenge**
Particularly wanted something to cover how to test for the output to be one of a random number of things (in this case Rock, Paper, Scissors!).  I will measure this by being able to go back to the weekend code and add a test

**Review my goals from last week**
I'm keeping a daily track of my progress/goals/how each day has gone.  But I've not been reviewing the weekly goals, so I'll go back and post-review these!  I will measure this by having something in each Monday's entry around last weeks goals, and add it to the template I have created.

### Summary

Code review with Tim, followed by week 4 kick off, which covered this weeks subject of databases, then coding in the afternoon with Tim towards this weeks Bookmark Manager challenge

### General Notes:

Morning review with Tim was nice, we gave each other some good feedback.  Also excited for working with Databases and SQL, as I have some prior knowledge having used a SQL database in my previous role, but interested to get it working with a website.  Afternoon pair with Tim was great, we made some great progress and enjoyed working together.

### Did I have fun?

Indeed - review was better than last time as we all get more used to what we're doing, and made some good progress with the weekly challenge and learnt a lot on the way

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, for sure.  Felt more relaxed reviewing someone elses code, and have learnt a lot about using a database with website

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Find exemplar (didn't manage to today!)
* Make a start on the weekend challenge

### Have I completed today's goals?

1/2 - have gone back and reviewed my goals, but didn't find an exemplar yet...is on todays list!

## Day 2:

### Goals for today

**Find an exemplar for the RPS Challenge and watch 20 mins if it**
Hangover Goal! Have found one, now need to watch!

**Have a look at the weekend challenge and make a start to the file structure**
I find if, at worst, I'm in a place to start writing tests/code on Friday night, it saves a lot of hassle getting the "admin" done before I can start the challenge.

### Summary

Morning was our own to do as we saw fit (I started watching an exemplar from this weekends challenge and then made a start on the one for the coming weekend).  In the afternoon I was pairing with Ali

### General Notes:

The exemplar wasn't as good as the previous one's, but I enjoyed learning a few things from the weekend. Notably the test writing and how they approached it differently to me.  For this weekend I've setup all my files/folders and have written my first (failing) test.

Afternoon with Ali was a great session.  We got on well and made some good progress on the bookmark manager challenge

### Did I have fun?

Yes, was nice to have a bit of a more relaxed morning plan and to then enjoy the coding with Ali

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, we learnt a lot about use of databases with ruby code this afternoon and got to use Table Plus too

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Watch some more of the exemplar
* Attend the Process Workshop

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes!  The spare time in the morning made it a lot easier

## Day 3:

### Goals for today

**Watch some more of the exemplar**
Made a good start yesterday, want to watch some more today

**Look into installing some of the VS Code features**
John referenced a few good tools (Rufo and endwise) which look useful.  I want to install them and look into how to run Rufo on save

### Summary

Morning John did a demo of splitting a class (from week 2) then the afternoon we had a Process Workshop and coding with Francesco

### General Notes:

The demo was a good, interactive session and demo'd how someone with more experience of coding and Ruby approaches something like that.  Showed me I should do more planning rather than jumping into tests and code!

Process workshop, I was paired with Claire, again! We had fun and I think we both learnt something.  Good to put yourself under pressure of showing someone else how you're approaching a task.

Finally only got just under an hour with Francesco to code.  We made a little progress but are going to find some time tomorrow to do some more

### Did I have fun?

Yes, as always fun to work with Claire and also Francesco!

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes - all three sessions I learnt something!

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Spend some more time with Francesco to make up for lack of time today
* Watch more exemplar

### Have I completed today's goals?

1/2 - I have installed a endwise which is useful and helps you not forget to add end's...haven't yet got rufo working on save, but not yet sure if I want to, or if I can make, say, rubocop -x run then anyway...

Only watched a small amount of the exemplar

## Day 4:

### Goals for today

None set

### Summary

Morning we had a Domain Modelling Databases Workshop, and then I paired with Chris in the afternoon

### General Notes:

Morning session on Domain modelling was similar to others, however for databases...good to understand the process.

Afternoon with Chris was good.  We progressed a lot on our bookmark manager, finishing number 11 which was tricky (around introducing a title and using that, with a link, for people to visit their bookmarked websites) - also learnt how to protect from sql injection (and, worrying, how to do sql injection!)

### Did I have fun?

Yes, especially the afternoon with Chris

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, understanding modelling for databases is useful and we learnt a lot in the afternoon pair

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

Main goal will be to make some significant progress on the weekend challenge

### Have I completed today's goals?

N/A

## Day 5:

### Goals for today

**Work through the weekend challenge**
It seems to be quite a big one, so I'm just making this my goal for today

### Summary

Morning we had free, I caught up with my peer group, JL guys and then had a 1:1 with my people manager, James, at JL...he is also a former maker.  Afternoon we had the retro, paired on the Bookmark Manager, I was with Trushna today.

There was also a project fair, demo'ing the projects of those coming to the end of their Makers journey

### General Notes:

Was nice to speak to everyone and check in with them...especially James, as nice to find out how the real world is, but also for him to understand where I am in the journey having done it himself!

Working with Trushna was lovely, we'd not worked together on anything before, so it was nice to meet and then make some decent progress towards the challenge.

Seeing the projects others have done was an eye opener to what is possible...and how much more we will learn in the next 8 weeks!

### Did I have fun?

Yes!

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, Trushna and I had some debugging to do, which re-enforced some of the principles and we made some further progress on the challenge

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

It's the weekend, so weekend challenge.

Next week we move on to a group project, so I want to see what that is all about and make some goals from there

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes - well I've started the weekend challenge!
