# Week 1 goals, notes and mini-diary!

## Weeks goals:

### As set out by Makers in the weekly outline:

* Build a simple web app with a database
* Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
* Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables)

### My own goals

* Watch an exemplar for the weekend challenge
* Try and complete more of the workshop/example learning provided in the week outline
* Add a review of the goals from last week!

## Day 1:

### Goals for today

**Find exemplar for this weekends challenge**
Particularly wanted something to cover how to test for the output to be one of a random number of things (in this case Rock, Paper, Scissors!).  I will measure this by being able to go back to the weekend code and add a test

**Review my goals from last week**
I'm keeping a daily track of my progress/goals/how each day has gone.  But I've not been reviewing the weekly goals, so I'll go back and post-review these!  I will measure this by having something in each Monday's entry around last weeks goals, and add it to the template I have created.

### Summary

Code review with Tim, followed by week 4 kick off, which covered this weeks subject of databases, then coding in the afternoon with Tim towards this weeks Bookmark Manager challenge

### General Notes:

Morning review with Tim was nice, we gave each other some good feedback.  Also excited for working with Databases and SQL, as I have some prior knowledge having used a SQL database in my previous role, but interested to get it working with a website.  Afternoon pair with Tim was great, we made some great progress and enjoyed working together.

### Did I have fun?

Indeed - review was better than last time as we all get more used to what we're doing, and made some good progress with the weekly challenge and learnt a lot on the way

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, for sure.  Felt more relaxed reviewing someone elses code, and have learnt a lot about using a database with website

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Find exemplar (didn't manage to today!)
* Make a start on the weekend challenge

### Have I completed today's goals?

1/2 - have gone back and reviewed my goals, but didn't find an exemplar yet...is on todays list!

## Day 2:

### Goals for today

**Find an exemplar for the RPS Challenge and watch 20 mins if it**
Hangover Goal! Have found one, now need to watch!

**Have a look at the weekend challenge and make a start to the file structure**
I find if, at worst, I'm in a place to start writing tests/code on Friday night, it saves a lot of hassle getting the "admin" done before I can start the challenge.
