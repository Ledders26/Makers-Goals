# Week 1 goals, notes and mini-diary!

## Weeks goals:

### As set out by Makers in the weekly outline:

* Test-drive a simple Javascript program running in a web browser, using modern JS build tools.
* Use the DOM API to build a web user interface for this program.
* Build a single-page web application fetching and updating remote data using JS.

### My own goals

* Try and complete the weekly challenge (I think it will be important for this weekends challenge)
* Meet with new mentee and run through pair programming

### How did I do with last weeks goals?

I feel I achieved the Makers goals, and most of my own, bar the refactoring of my weekend goals

## Day 1:

### Goals for today

I struggled with a nasty cold over the weekend and today, so my main focus was on getting as much work done as possible!

### Summary

In the morning I did a code review of the weekend challenge with Haroon, then we had a kick off and pair programming was planned for the afternoon

### General Notes:

Difficult day, because of the cold and sore throat I skipped the pairing in the afternoon.  The kick off was good though, and excited for the week ahead

### Did I have fun?

Not really - but not due to the course

### Am I a better programmer?

No, but I know what's coming this week and have done the basic prep work to kick on tomorrow and learn how to use JS within a website

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Pair programme

### Have I completed today's goals?

Didn't have any!

## Day 2:

### Goals for today

* Schedule meeting with mentee
* Catch up with work missed yesterday

### Summary

Morning was left open for us to self lead learning, then I was with Eddie in the afternoon.

### General Notes:

Generously Eddie agreed to start early, at 12, for pairing so we could catch up.  We had a great session, learnt a lot and moved on to stage 15

### Did I have fun?

Yes a lot!

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, and made up for the lack of progress yesterday

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Meet with mentee (planned for 11)
* Try to pass on some tips to him
* Go back over what was done today to make sure it's all sunk in!

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes, catch up with mentee booked for tomorrow

## Day 3:

### Goals for today

* Go back on yesterdays progress, make sure all understood.
* Prep for mentee meeting

### Summary

Again no workshops, but I met up with Joe (who asked me to be a mentor) for a catchup and pair programming session.  Afternoon I was with Charlotte working on the weekly challenge

### General Notes:

Enjoyed meeting with Joe, he's starting on the 21st March so is currently busy doing the prep weeks and learning Ruby.  We had a good pairing session and completed the daily Kata.

Afternoon was with Charlotte, who was a few steps behind but I really enjoyed working (and chatting) with her, and helped me achieve a goal of going back over the previous days work.  Really felt useful and helped cement the ideas in my head.

### Did I have fun?

Yes, both with Joe and Charlotte

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, having cemented what we did yesterday it cleared some of it up in my head.

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Try and make as much progress as possible with the weekly challenge

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes :)
