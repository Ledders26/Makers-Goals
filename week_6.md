# Week 1 goals, notes and mini-diary!

## Weeks goals:

### As set out by Makers in the weekly outline:

* Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
* Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.
* Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

### My own goals

* Focus on JavaScript development
* Attend another Process Workshop
* Refactor weekend code and add more tests
* Reflect on last weeks group challenge and come up with some goals for the next one in week 8

### How did I do with last weeks goals?

Achieved almost all of them.  All of the Makers Goals, for my own I didn't do the logon/logoff work for our project, but as Bromley had done it I reviewed the code to try and get a better understanding.

I did use documentation for the weekend project, but my README wasn't much better, although it was also a project where there was less documentation needed as was a Bowling Scorecard that could be turned into an API

## Day 1:

### Goals for today

These are extensions of my weekly goals really - I focussed on starting to learn JavaScript, but these are them as put into my peer group chat.  I have added them to the weekly goals

**refactor my weekend challenge code and add more tests**
I wasn't happy with parts of my weekend challenge and it needs more tests! I can measure this by ensuring I cover as many edge cases as I can

**reflect on the group challenge and come up with some goals for the next one**
Many parts of last week were great but could be improved on - I will add a list of goals for the next one to a doc and refer to it for the next one

### Summary

Morning was spent doing a code review with Ben P, a kick off meeting and then coding with Ben in the afternoon

### General Notes:

Code Review was good, Ben and I had a good discussion about how we approached the challenge and it's difficulties and learnings.  The kick off gave us a good way of trying to take skills from one language into a new one and create a cheatsheet.

Finally Ben and I worked through the start of the weeks challenge, which to start with is an intro to JavaScript.  We also had to fix a local permissions issue to allow Ben to run NVM

### Did I have fun?

Yes

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, today was a big development day - I consider myself to have learnt the following:

* Some basics on learning a new language
* Creating a language cheatsheet
* The basics of JavaScript
  * functions, variables, classes, Data types, Mathematical operators
* Some fundamentals of how NVM works
* How to install Node

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Continue to work on the development of JavaScript

### Have I completed today's goals?

They're more weekly goals, not complete yet but I didn't expect them to be.

## Day 2:

### Goals for today

**lookup what static is**
was mentioned in the meeting earlier and I didn't understand it!

**write down some plans for doing the bowling challenge this weekend**
Having chatting it through with Shirley, she gave me a good idea about doing an actual scorecard :slightly_smiling_face:

### Summary

In the morning we had an intro to Debugging JS, which was the first time we were with Alex the coach.  Afternoon I was paired with Shirley for the weekly challenge - she was my first pair so we've paired with everyone now.

### General Notes:

The debugging session introduced something called follow the flow, which I enjoyed.  Gave me a good new skill for debugging.

Afternoon with Shirley was great.  We got a lot of work done and laughed a lot along the way.  She's a joy to work with

### Did I have fun?

Yes, a lot!

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, new debugging skills, and progressed quite a lot with JavaScript skills in the weekly challenge

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Update my JS cheatsheet

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes, have written down some notes for this weekends challenge around writing a scoreboard as well as a score (using a separate Array for each).  Also looked up Static, which seems to mean that rather than being instances of a class, are called on the class itself, and can be called within a separate static method within the same class using this
