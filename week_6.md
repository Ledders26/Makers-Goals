# Week 1 goals, notes and mini-diary!

## Weeks goals:

### As set out by Makers in the weekly outline:

* Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
* Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.
* Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

### My own goals

* Focus on JavaScript development
* Attend another Process Workshop
* Refactor weekend code and add more tests
* Reflect on last weeks group challenge and come up with some goals for the next one in week 8

### How did I do with last weeks goals?

Achieved almost all of them.  All of the Makers Goals, for my own I didn't do the logon/logoff work for our project, but as Bromley had done it I reviewed the code to try and get a better understanding.

I did use documentation for the weekend project, but my README wasn't much better, although it was also a project where there was less documentation needed as was a Bowling Scorecard that could be turned into an API

## Day 1:

### Goals for today

These are extensions of my weekly goals really - I focussed on starting to learn JavaScript, but these are them as put into my peer group chat.  I have added them to the weekly goals

**refactor my weekend challenge code and add more tests**
I wasn't happy with parts of my weekend challenge and it needs more tests! I can measure this by ensuring I cover as many edge cases as I can

**reflect on the group challenge and come up with some goals for the next one**
Many parts of last week were great but could be improved on - I will add a list of goals for the next one to a doc and refer to it for the next one

### Summary

Morning was spent doing a code review with Ben P, a kick off meeting and then coding with Ben in the afternoon

### General Notes:

Code Review was good, Ben and I had a good discussion about how we approached the challenge and it's difficulties and learnings.  The kick off gave us a good way of trying to take skills from one language into a new one and create a cheatsheet.

Finally Ben and I worked through the start of the weeks challenge, which to start with is an intro to JavaScript.  We also had to fix a local permissions issue to allow Ben to run NVM

### Did I have fun?

Yes

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, today was a big development day - I consider myself to have learnt the following:

* Some basics on learning a new language
* Creating a language cheatsheet
* The basics of JavaScript
  * functions, variables, classes, Data types, Mathematical operators
* Some fundamentals of how NVM works
* How to install Node

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Continue to work on the development of JavaScript

### Have I completed today's goals?

They're more weekly goals, not complete yet but I didn't expect them to be.

## Day 2:

### Goals for today

**lookup what static is**
was mentioned in the meeting earlier and I didn't understand it!

**write down some plans for doing the bowling challenge this weekend**
Having chatting it through with Shirley, she gave me a good idea about doing an actual scorecard :slightly_smiling_face:

### Summary

In the morning we had an intro to Debugging JS, which was the first time we were with Alex the coach.  Afternoon I was paired with Shirley for the weekly challenge - she was my first pair so we've paired with everyone now.

### General Notes:

The debugging session introduced something called follow the flow, which I enjoyed.  Gave me a good new skill for debugging.

Afternoon with Shirley was great.  We got a lot of work done and laughed a lot along the way.  She's a joy to work with

### Did I have fun?

Yes, a lot!

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, new debugging skills, and progressed quite a lot with JavaScript skills in the weekly challenge

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Update my JS cheatsheet

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes, have written down some notes for this weekends challenge around writing a scoreboard as well as a score (using a separate Array for each).  Also looked up Static, which seems to mean that rather than being instances of a class, are called on the class itself, and can be called within a separate static method within the same class using this

## Day 3:

### Goals for today

**Update my JavaScript cheatsheet**
I've learnt a lot of new JavaScript and want to make sure I have it noted down, especially with the weekend challenge looming.

### Summary

In the morning we had an EQ workshop with Dana on working as a team, then afternoon I did another Process Workshop and then paired with Marie

### General Notes:

Morning workshop was interesting and we discussed DISC, which groups people by their traits and how they behave/respond to situations.  We discussed how to behave with different types of people, and how it's important to have a mix in any team.

The Process Workshop was brilliant.  Was paired with Niclolas from the Feb cohort, I'd like to think we both taught each other something, I came away with a few new shortcuts and some good feedback on my coding.

Finally had a brief pairing session with Marie - we made some good progress even though we had limited time

### Did I have fun?

Yes, very enjoyable day

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, took some good information from the EQ session, as well as from the process workshop and Marie and I learnt a fair bit in the afternoon

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Complete my DISC questionnaire
* Update my JS cheatsheet (I didn't achieve it today!)

### Have I completed today's goals?

No...

## Day 4:

### Goals for today

**Complete my DISC questionnaire**
After the EQ session yesterday I want to complete this questionnaire and use it to reflect on what drives me

**Update my JS cheatsheet**
Since yesterday I've learnt even more and need to update my cheatsheet!

### Summary

Morning session with John about callbacks, then paired with Jack in the afternoon

### General Notes:

I found callbacks an interesting feature of JavaScript, and one which I suspect we'll use a lot!  Good session with John.  As I'd established from Jack that he was a bit ahead, I used the break between the two to do some catching up and got up to the same point...

Jack and I had a great session.  Worked through a very good amount of work and learnt a lot on the way.  Always enjoy working with Jack

### Did I have fun?

Yes

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, for sure.  Understanding callbacks is good, the use of work queues via time delays too.  Also, made good progress with Jack and both practiced what I've learnt already (not least writing of functions and tests) and some newer features

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Make a start on the weekend challenge

### Have I completed today's goals?

Mostly - have done the DISC questionnaire and updated large part of my cheatsheet though not all

## Day 5:

### Goals for today

**Make a start on the weekend challenge!**
As we have most of this morning free of any workshops, I want to make a start at doing this weekends challenge (which is basically last weekends challenge, but in JavaScript!)

### Summary

After the usual peer group catch up, and JL catch up, made a start on the weekend challenge.  Afternoon was the weekly retro then pairing with Chloe

### General Notes:

There was a bit of debate in the retro around the difficulty of the weekend challenges.  My personal view is I like that they are hard.  I signed up for this to be a challenge, to push me and to continuously learn.  That said, I appreciate some of the cohort are struggling and we need to ensure, as a Cohort, we can support those guys.

After that, the session with Chloe was fun.  We covered ground I'd completed earlier in the week, but I think that benefitted me in as much as JS is new, and therefore doing more of it is enforcing it in my head!

### Did I have fun?

Yes, throughout the day

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, I've re-enforced my weeks learning, have done a little coaching and Chloe showed me I should be more organised!

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

It's the weekend so........weekend challenge!

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes
