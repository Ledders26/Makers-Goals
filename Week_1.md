# Week 1 goals, notes and mini-diary!

## Day 1:

### General Notes:

    Lovely to meet the cohort and coaches.  Nice way to introduce the course and feel enthusiastic about the next 12 weeks

### Did I have fun?
    Yes, nice to meet the new team.  Initial thoughts/concerns removed as everyone in same boat

### Am I a better programmer?
    Not at this stage, but I'm excited to become one!

### What do I want to do tomorrow?
    Learn more about TDD
    Attend Meditation and consider impact
    Do first bit of pair programming and provide some initial thoughts

## Day 2:

### General Notes:

    Enjoyed first meditation course.  Relaxed and envigorated me and want to do more to see what I can continue to get out of it

### Did I have fun?

    Yes, learning about TDD was a lot of fun and my first experience of some proper pairing on the course was enjoyable.  Shirley was a big help, and we learnt more than probably either of us would have expected to.

    I also enjoyed meditation.  I think it's something I want to continue to try, it may not be for me, but if it can help then best to try!

### Am I a better programmer?

    For sure.  I've learnt how to solve an issue with a local github repo, re-clone and delete the old one...

    But more importantly I've learnt some basics around rspec, writing tests and looping through unit tests, feature tests and improving the code/solving the errors.

    It has also been a nice introduction into error handling, and understanding errors aren't necessarily a bad thing, they are a large part of TDD

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

    More meditation @ 9am
    Get as much out of afternoon pairing as possible
    In the morning, after daily catch up, look into pair programming and have a better understanding of driver/navigator style

### Did I achieve yesterdays goals today?

    Yes :)

## Day 3:

### General Notes:

    Continued meditation, is proving to be a nice way to start the working day

### Did I have fun?

    Less so than yesterday, myself and my pairing partner (Marie) struggle more today as the tasks ramped up in difficulty.  That said we tried to maintain some positivity, and are going to come back to finish off step 11 tomorrow between the morning session and afternoon pair programming.  It's also nice pairing with someone different each day, getting to know them more, and Marie and I got on well.
    
    Also, had our first group check in.  Was nice to hear most people in the same boat and finding it quite a challenge.  I think as I was fortunate enough to speak to some previous Makers, I expected this so it's maybe less of a shock, but is still a steep learning curve, but one which the cohort and our group seem to be happy and excited to tackle head on.

### Am I a better programmer?    
    
    Yes. I tried (and hopefully succeeded) to use better techniques I'd read up about for Driver/Navigator pair programming.  Am also getting more to grips with the idea of writing a test to help shape the code/solution.

    In order to re-enforce the TDD I've started the dice app which was some additional work as part of the TDD training on Day 2

    Also learnt a bit about attr_reader, though I want to more reading and have a better understanding tomorrow!

### What to I want to achieve tomorrow?

    Find out more about attr_reader.
    Attend and understand the basics of Debugging
    Attend morning meditation.  Whilst this is repetitive, am keen to make it a habit, to see how much benefit it can give

### Did I achieve yesterdays goals today?

    Yes!
