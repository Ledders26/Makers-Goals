# Week 1 goals, notes and mini-diary!

## Day 1:

### Summary

    Intro to students and cohort, intro to EQ/Meditation with Dana, details of the first week

### General Notes:

    Lovely to meet the cohort and coaches.  Nice way to introduce the course and feel enthusiastic about the next 12 weeks

### Did I have fun?
    Yes, nice to meet the new team.  Initial thoughts/concerns removed as everyone in same boat

### Am I a better programmer?
    Not at this stage, but I'm excited to become one!

### What do I want to do tomorrow?
    Learn more about TDD
    Attend Meditation and consider impact
    Do first bit of pair programming and provide some initial thoughts

## Day 2:

### Summary

    TDD Workshop, First Pair Programming for Boris Bikes challenge

### General Notes:

    Enjoyed first meditation course.  Relaxed and envigorated me and want to do more to see what I can continue to get out of it

### Did I have fun?

    Yes, learning about TDD was a lot of fun and my first experience of some proper pairing on the course was enjoyable.  Shirley was a big help, and we learnt more than probably either of us would have expected to.

    I also enjoyed meditation.  I think it's something I want to continue to try, it may not be for me, but if it can help then best to try!

### Am I a better programmer?

    For sure.  I've learnt how to solve an issue with a local github repo, re-clone and delete the old one...

    But more importantly I've learnt some basics around rspec, writing tests and looping through unit tests, feature tests and improving the code/solving the errors.

    It has also been a nice introduction into error handling, and understanding errors aren't necessarily a bad thing, they are a large part of TDD

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

    More meditation @ 9am
    Get as much out of afternoon pairing as possible
    In the morning, after daily catch up, look into pair programming and have a better understanding of driver/navigator style

### Did I achieve yesterdays goals today?

    Yes :)

## Day 3:

### Summary

    Intro to goal setting, first Peer Group check-in and then more challenge pairing

### General Notes:

    Continued meditation, is proving to be a nice way to start the working day

### Did I have fun?

    Less so than yesterday, myself and my pairing partner (Marie) struggle more today as the tasks ramped up in difficulty.  That said we tried to maintain some positivity, and are going to come back to finish off step 11 tomorrow between the morning session and afternoon pair programming.  It's also nice pairing with someone different each day, getting to know them more, and Marie and I got on well.
    
    Also, had our first group check in.  Was nice to hear most people in the same boat and finding it quite a challenge.  I think as I was fortunate enough to speak to some previous Makers, I expected this so it's maybe less of a shock, but is still a steep learning curve, but one which the cohort and our group seem to be happy and excited to tackle head on.

### Am I a better programmer?    
    
    Yes. I tried (and hopefully succeeded) to use better techniques I'd read up about for Driver/Navigator pair programming.  Am also getting more to grips with the idea of writing a test to help shape the code/solution.

    In order to re-enforce the TDD I've started the dice app which was some additional work as part of the TDD training on Day 2

    Also learnt a bit about attr_reader, though I want to more reading and have a better understanding tomorrow!

### What to I want to achieve tomorrow?

    Find out more about attr_reader.
    Attend and understand the basics of Debugging
    Attend morning meditation.  Whilst this is repetitive, am keen to make it a habit, to see how much benefit it can give

### Did I achieve yesterdays goals today?

    Yes!

## Day 4:

### Overview

    Debugging workshop then pairing

### General Notes:

    Debugging workshop was a good insight into how to narrow down an error by adding output to record what's happening in the code as it steps through. Also, nice demo on how to break down lines/blocks of code

    Afternoon coding was brilliant, really felt like Jack and I made some real progress in the afternoon and sharpened up our pairing skills. 

### Did I have fun?

    A lot, finished the day feeling great and with more confidence about the course, the Boris Bikes challenge and my capability to use TDD and pair programming.  The process of writing feature then unit tests followed by the code is starting to sink in.

### Am I a better programmer?

    Definitely, the session on debugging taught me a lot, and Jack and I used those in the afternoon.  As mentioned above my pairing skills improved too

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

    Go back to attr_reader (from yesterday)
    Finish off final part which Jack and I worked on today
    Do more work on Dice app
    Complete the additional work from the debugging session

### Did I achieve yesterdays goals today?

    No, as I haven't fully understood attr_reader

## Day 5:

### General Notes:

    First retro, which was good and nice to see everyone working together and the general good feeling around the cohort.

### Did I have fun?

    Yes!  Enjoyed catching up with both my peer group and the JL guys in the morning, retro brought us all together and then pairing with Chloe was fun in the afternoon.  Have also enjoyed tonight working on the weekend challenge and getting it (mostly) done!

### Am I a better programmer?

    Yes, have given some constructive feedback, and received some, around driver/navigator...both with the same conclusion that the line between them when driving is hard (as you want to contribute to the solution).

    Debugging also improved and have learnt about doubles and stubs, which seem a great method of testing

    I've also got a lot better at writing rspec tests.

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

    Well, more for Monday and all of next week!

    1. Speak to coach about how to add an rspec test that does a check on an Array containing (or not) a specific value
    2. Get some feedback on weekend challenge
    3. Go back on some of the missed bits from week 1, including TDD and Debugging examples and possible finishing Boris Bikes
    4. Provide and gather more feedback

### Did I achieve yesterdays goals today?

    I've achieved 2/4, though during the day I added one for giving Jack some feedback on pairing, which I did.  Those not done are included above


## Week summary

    Overall I've thoroughly enjoyed the first week.  The cohort all seem lovely, we're all supporting each other, there's people from many different backgrounds and no one seems to want to shirk the hard work.  I think by the end of 12 weeks we'll be very close.

    I've learnt so much.  Not just TDD, Debugging, coding, pair programming etc that is part of the course, and meditation which has been a revelation, but about myself.  I've enjoyed it even more than I thought possible, despite the amount of work, the late nights, and very hectic days.  Can't wait for week 2.
