# Week 1 goals, notes and mini-diary!

## Day 1:

### General Notes:

    Lovely to meet the cohort and coaches.  Nice way to introduce the course and feel enthusiastic about the next 12 weeks

### Did I have fun?
    Yes, nice to meet the new team.  Initial thoughts/concerns removed as everyone in same boat

### Am I a better programmer?
    Not at this stage, but I'm excited to become one!

### What do I want to do tomorrow?
    Learn more about TDD
    Attend Meditation and consider impact
    Do first bit of pair programming and provide some initial thoughts

## Day 2:

### General Notes:

    Enjoyed first meditation course.  Relaxed and envigorated me and want to do more to see what I can continue to get out of it

### Did I have fun?

    Yes, learning about TDD was a lot of fun and my first experience of some proper pairing on the course was enjoyable.  Shirley was a big help, and we learnt more than probably either of us would have expected to.

    I also enjoyed meditation.  I think it's something I want to continue to try, it may not be for me, but if it can help then best to try!

### Am I a better programmer?

    For sure.  I've learnt how to solve an issue with a local github repo, re-clone and delete the old one...

    But more importantly I've learnt some basics around rspec, writing tests and looping through unit tests, feature tests and improving the code/solving the errors.

    It has also been a nice introduction into error handling, and understanding errors aren't necessarily a bad thing, they are a large part of TDD

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

    More meditation @ 9am
    Get as much out of afternoon pairing as possible
    In the morning, start to look more at Outstanding goals as there's no pre-set work

### Did I achieve yesterdays goals today?

    Yes :)
