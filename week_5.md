# Week 5 goals, notes and mini-diary!

## Weeks goals:

### As set out by Makers in the weekly outline:

* Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
* Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
* Run stand-ups and retrospectives
* Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
* Give and receive meaningful code review

### My own goals

* As it was mentioned early on, we will run our own cohort wide retro.  I will volunteer to do this as I think it'll help me improve in this area
* Find tools, other than JIRA, to manage a Kanban board
* Try and code the login/logout of users, as I didn't get round to this either last week, or in the weekend challenge
* Use documentation for my weekend challenge (ie process maps etc) and do a better README - ideally not at the end, but as I go

## Day 1:

### Goals for today

Didn't set any - I got a bit over-excited about the group challenge!

### Summary

After a code review in the morning with Jane (her Chitter looked brilliant) we got put into a group to start our weekly challenge of an Airbnb style website

### General Notes:

Loved reviewing code with Jane!  We had a laugh and chatted a lot about our code.  Mine needs some work, but we move onto the next stage, and I've taken some learns from it

Then we moved into our groups. I am with Dash, Sarah, Haroon and Bromley.  We started well...have all documentation done, have written out all user stories and identified what we need to do to achieve MVP

### Did I have fun?

Yes - loved setting up a new project and meeting with Jane!

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, documentation/diagrams/process maps isn't something I've spend enough time on, so was good to.  Also, great insight into how to start breaking down a project

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

If we get round to it, do some login/logout work

### Have I completed today's goals?

N/A

## Day 2:

### Goals for today

**Get involved with the work in our project around login and logout**
I didn't get to this stage last week or this weekend so I'd like to get involved with it within our Group Project

### Summary

Working on our group project

### General Notes:

We made a decision, via some research from Bromley, to use Sequel, an ORM tool, to help us reduce the amount of code and not require hard coded SQL.  I like this idea, though I think it's:

* difficult to understand the concept
* something that maybe the rest of the group is struggling with
...

So, we've agreed tonight in the retro we need to make sure we understand it better tomorrow.

We also did less coding than I expected today, as Bromley and I did a lot of DB setup, documentation for that and working our processes for ways of working.

We also moved to use github Projects rather than a basic Kanban board

### Did I have fun?

Rollercoaster day, but some fun!

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, understand better DB setup, Sequel and running a project!

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Some coding!
* Make sure the group feel happier with Sequel
* Setup Database on my local machine

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes

## Day 3:

### Goals for today

I've stopped setting goals this week - working in a group we have our own tickets etc to achieve and at the moment we're working on tickets/issues as they come in.

### Summary

After going through how Sequel worked in the morning, I broke off with Haroon to mainly do some css setup

### General Notes:

Morning was interesting to try and learn but also teach some of the rest of the group how to use Sequel, and tie it back to SQL queries and how they tie in.

In the afternoon, Haroon and I closed off a small bit of functionality then worked on some css/html setup to make it look better

### Did I have fun?

Yes, learning/teaching and then doing css, which I always love

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, learning and checking my understanding of Sequel really helped today

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

As above, no going to add goals as such, but want to press on with the group challenge and help the rest of the team learn where possible

### Have I completed today's goals?

N/A

## Day 4:

### Goals for today

N/A

### Summary

Ongoing group project

### General Notes:

After doing a standup and demo'ing code, we also then merged and resolved conflicts, which I'd not done before using Git.  In the afternoon Dash and I paired, and we did some fixing of the pages which added and then showed available spaces (or properties) and the bookings pages.

In the evening I did some more work solo too, after the kids were in bed, to make sure we're as ready as we can be for the presentation tomorrow.

### Did I have fun?

Yes, good learning and enjoyed coding with Dash

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, practicing merging was good to do, and in the evening I did flashes (where you send error handling back through pages by recording and then recalling a flash code line)

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

N/A

### Have I completed today's goals?

N/A

## Day 5:

### Goals for today

Didn't set any officially but before the day starts:
* update the website to make the css better and add buttons where possible
* do a quick presentation
* run the weekly team retro with Claire

### Summary

Again, some merging in the morning, then we did a group coding session to sort out any remaining bits, presented our website and then retro, which Claire and I led

### General Notes:

Enjoyable.  We made the website more presentable (though my CSS has a lot to learn!), demo'd it and then ran the retro, which was fun.

Overall nice to see the different approaches to the task...and the different things some peopled used.  css frameworks, ORM's (like us using Sequel), different Agile tools etc

### Did I have fun?

Yes, today was a good day!

### Am I a better programmer?

I think so - learnt a bit more css, ran my first large retro and at the retro had a chance to pass on some stuff, as well as learn from what others have done

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

Weekend challenge!

### Have I completed today's goals?

N/A
