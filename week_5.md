# Week 5 goals, notes and mini-diary!

## Weeks goals:

### As set out by Makers in the weekly outline:

* Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
* Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
* Run stand-ups and retrospectives
* Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
* Give and receive meaningful code review

### My own goals

* As it was mentioned early on, we will run our own cohort wide retro.  I will volunteer to do this as I think it'll help me improve in this area
* Find tools, other than JIRA, to manage a Kanban board
* Try and code the login/logout of users, as I didn't get round to this either last week, or in the weekend challenge
* Use documentation for my weekend challenge (ie process maps etc) and do a better README - ideally not at the end, but as I go

## Day 1:

### Goals for today

Didn't set any - I got a bit over-excited about the group challenge!

### Summary

After a code review in the morning with Jane (her Chitter looked brilliant) we got put into a group to start our weekly challenge of an Airbnb style website

### General Notes:

Loved reviewing code with Jane!  We had a laugh and chatted a lot about our code.  Mine needs some work, but we move onto the next stage, and I've taken some learns from it

Then we moved into our groups. I am with Dash, Sarah, Haroon and Bromley.  We started well...have all documentation done, have written out all user stories and identified what we need to do to achieve MVP

### Did I have fun?

Yes - loved setting up a new project and meeting with Jane!

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, documentation/diagrams/process maps isn't something I've spend enough time on, so was good to.  Also, great insight into how to start breaking down a project

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

If we get round to it, do some login/logout work

### Have I completed today's goals?

N/A

## Day 2:

### Goals for today

**Get involved with the work in our project around login and logout**
I didn't get to this stage last week or this weekend so I'd like to get involved with it within our Group Project

### Summary

Working on our group project

### General Notes:

We made a decision, via some research from Bromley, to use Sequel, an ORM tool, to help us reduce the amount of code and not require hard coded SQL.  I like this idea, though I think it's:

* difficult to understand the concept
* something that maybe the rest of the group is struggling with
...

So, we've agreed tonight in the retro we need to make sure we understand it better tomorrow.

We also did less coding than I expected today, as Bromley and I did a lot of DB setup, documentation for that and working our processes for ways of working.

We also moved to use guthub Projects rather than a basic Kanban board

### Did I have fun?

Rollercoaster day, but some fun!

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, understand better DB setup, Sequel and running a project!

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Some coding!
* Make sure the group feel happier with Sequel
* Setup Database on my local machine

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes
