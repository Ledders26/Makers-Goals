# Week 2 goals, notes and mini-diary!

## Weeks goals:

### As set out by Makers in the weekly outline:

* Build a simple web app
* Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
* Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
* Explain the MVC pattern

### My own goals

* Watch an exemplar for the Takeaway challenge from the weekend just gone.
* Revisit the weekend challenge and add the Twilio work, which I didn't get round to

### How did I do with last weeks goals?

I feel I achieved all of the Makers pre-set goals, and could answer all those questions. As for my own, I didn't do the dice app, but I feel now the work I've done since has made it largely irrelevant as we've moved on from there.  I did use more of the resource however

## Day 1:

### Goals for today

I didn't set any - see Summary

### Summary

Difficult day, my youngest child (Annie) was in hospital overnight after being taken in with a bad chest infection, so I stayed with her overnight and missed the morning session, only joining Dash for the afternoon

### General Notes:

What I did with Dash was good - intro to more Frontend principles, HTML, CSS and the MVC pattern.  Dash was really good and gave me a lowdon of the morning I'd missed

### Did I have fun?

In the afternoon, yes.  Dash was nice to work with

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, despite the adversity at the end of the day I'd learnt a lot about the basics of web development

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Go back and watch the Week 3 kick off meeting which has been recorded
* Find exemplar and begin watching for takeaway challenge

### Have I completed today's goals?

None set...givem the lack of sleep being in hospital then coming into the afternoon cold, surviving was more than enough!

## Day 2:

### Goals for today

**Spend a bit more time with Dash to complete yesterdays work**
As I had to finish early, we're going to revisit the afternoon challenge and try and complete a few more steps ahead of the afternoon.  I will measure this just by the amount of time we spend (plan is 45 mins to an hour)

**Start watching takeaway exemplar**
I believe it's a 90 minute video, so if I can spend 25 mins each day I will have watched it by the end of the week, so to measure success today, I want to have watched first 25 mins at least

### Summary

In the morning we had an intro to HTTP process modelling, then I spent 30 mins with Dash to make up for the lost time from yesterday and then pair coding with Peter

### General Notes:

Process modelling for HTTP seems far more binary - there's less interpretation/freedom than their is for defining classes etc.  But I think I prefer that!  Was a good session.  Then Dash and I cleared off a few more steps on the daily challenge before I paired with Peter.  Had a good session and have started work on the actual Battle application after an intro to how Sinatra and capybara works.

### Did I have fun?

Yes - it's fun learning new things which definitely this week has been doing

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, learnt some starting tips on creating and testing web sites, using capybara and Sinatra.  Also the modelling session was good to help us work out how we're going to create them

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Watch another 25 mins of the exemplar
* After watching the start of the emeplar, maybe go back and find some exercises on Doubling - I understand the idea, but some of what I saw opened my eyes to more you can do with them!

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes

## Day 3:

### Goals for today

**Watch another 25 mins of the exemplar from this weekend gone**
I've broken it up into daily chunks so it doesn't feel like a 90 minute video I have to find time for.  Found really beneficial so far

**Go back and review more about doubles and mocks**
Watching the exemplar, I don't feel comfortable enough with mocking yet, so going to go back and try to familiarise myself with them more

### Summary

In the morning we had an EQ session with Dana about empathy, then in the afternoon I paired with Jaroslaw on the battle app

### General Notes:

Enjoyed the empathy session - I think two reasons, I've had empathy sessions before, but I find Dana a very inspirational talker on EQ, but also it's sometimes nice meeting with the cohort and not discussing coding or programming methods, and gives everyone a chance to express themselves a little more.

Afternoon with Jaroslaw was also good.  We made some good progress with the intro to web development and have done the bare bones of the Battle app

### Did I have fun?

Yes - as above, found the empathy session good and entertaining and myself and Jaroslaw paired well but also found out we both have 2 daughters who are almost exactly the same age!

### Am I a better programmer?

I think so.  I don't feel I learnt anything new but I have reinforced the learning from the start of the week

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

Going to keep tomorrow quite simple:

* attend debugging and hopefully understand better the difference between how we debug the backend and frontend style of development
* Attend the evening social event (quiz)

### Have I completed today's goals?

1 yes, I have gone back and found a useful website explaining mocking/stubs/doubles.  Really helped as it was about a payment gateway, so a subject I understand from my previous role at JL

## Day 4:

### Goals for today

N.B. Written after the morning debugging session:

**look more into debugging a website**
Felt like I still had some questions after this mornings session - will try and find something on google to assist
**Go to the quiz**
Be nice to socialise a bit!!

### Summary

Morning session on debugging a website.  Afternoon pair with Claire, and then a quiz 5-6

### General Notes:

Not sure it all went in tbh from the morning session.  I don't think it helped that we had a short period of time when we split up to look through it and therefore didn't have time to understand the aim/function/layout of the web site we were trying to fix, which made the session harder to follow...in the afternoon when debugging the battle app we've written I found it far easier to understand and therefore find problems.

Afternoon pairing with Claire was a joy.  Really good to work with, bounced off each other and made some really good progress.  Looking forward to working with her again in the future

### Did I have fun?

Yes, in the afternoon.  Found I was a bit concerned after the morning, but the afternoon was far better

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, Claire and I working enforced that I do know more about the debugging that I had thought after the morning, and our work really drilled home the MVC model and how it ties in

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Start on the weekend challenge (ideally during the day)
* Check in with the JL guys
* Book catch up with my JL people manager (and former Maker!)
* Look at the resources sent around debugging, to make sure I am happy with it

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes, they weren't too stretching!

## Day 5:

### Goals for today

**Start working on weekend challenge**
I'd like to make a start before the afternoon pairing and then crack on in the evening to get the bulk done before tomorrow

**Review some of the Debugging stuff**
I noticed Leo sent through something we can look at - want to confirm some of my understanding.

### Summary

Morning had no workshops, but had a longer catch up with peer group and then the JL guys.  Also did some looking in to Debugging which helped me a fair bit.  Afternoon, after the retro Meg and I did some good work on the Battle App

### General Notes:

Always nice to check in with everyone on a Friday and see how we're all getting on.  Some good positivity about this week.

Then the afternoon, it was good to hear how everyone reflected on the week.  Coding with Meg was nice, we know each other from the peer group.  We had a good laugh and tidied up some historical code, fixed some tests and advanced a few steps too, so in 3 hours a good return.  

### Did I have fun?

Yes, especially in the afternoon pairing!

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes - debugging better (and indeed then this afternoon with Meg we had a fair bit of debugging to do!)

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

As it's the weekend, my only goal I can look at is the weekend challenge.  Then next week will be something new to learn and new goals!

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes, well I'm about to start on the weekend challenge after finishing this!
