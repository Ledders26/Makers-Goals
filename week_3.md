# Week 2 goals, notes and mini-diary!

## Weeks goals:

### As set out by Makers in the weekly outline:

* Build a simple web app
* Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
* Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
* Explain the MVC pattern

### My own goals

* Watch an exemplar for the Takeaway challenge from the weekend just gone.
* Revisit the weekend challenge and add the Twilio work, which I didn't get round to

### How did I do with last weeks goals?

I feel I achieved all of the Makers pre-set goals, and could answer all those questions. As for my own, I didn't do the dice app, but I feel now the work I've done since has made it largely irrelevant as we've moved on from there.  I did use more of the resource however

## Day 1:

### Goals for today

I didn't set any - see Summary

### Summary

Difficult day, my youngest child (Annie) was in hospital overnight after being taken in with a bad chest infection, so I stayed with her overnight and missed the morning session, only joining Dash for the afternoon

### General Notes:

What I did with Dash was good - intro to more Frontend principles, HTML, CSS and the MVC pattern.  Dash was really good and gave me a lowdon of the morning I'd missed

### Did I have fun?

In the afternoon, yes.  Dash was nice to work with

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, despite the adversity at the end of the day I'd learnt a lot about the basics of web development

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Go back and watch the Week 3 kick off meeting which has been recorded
* Find exemplar and begin watching for takeaway challenge

### Have I completed today's goals?

None set...givem the lack of sleep being in hospital then coming into the afternoon cold, surviving was more than enough!
