# Week 2 goals, notes and mini-diary!

## Weeks goals:

### As set out by Makers in the weekly outline:

* Build a simple web app
* Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
* Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
* Explain the MVC pattern

### My own goals

* Watch an exemplar for the Takeaway challenge from the weekend just gone.
* Revisit the weekend challenge and add the Twilio work, which I didn't get round to

### How did I do with last weeks goals?

I feel I achieved all of the Makers pre-set goals, and could answer all those questions. As for my own, I didn't do the dice app, but I feel now the work I've done since has made it largely irrelevant as we've moved on from there.  I did use more of the resource however

## Day 1:

### Goals for today

I didn't set any - see Summary

### Summary

Difficult day, my youngest child (Annie) was in hospital overnight after being taken in with a bad chest infection, so I stayed with her overnight and missed the morning session, only joining Dash for the afternoon

### General Notes:

What I did with Dash was good - intro to more Frontend principles, HTML, CSS and the MVC pattern.  Dash was really good and gave me a lowdon of the morning I'd missed

### Did I have fun?

In the afternoon, yes.  Dash was nice to work with

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, despite the adversity at the end of the day I'd learnt a lot about the basics of web development

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Go back and watch the Week 3 kick off meeting which has been recorded
* Find exemplar and begin watching for takeaway challenge

### Have I completed today's goals?

None set...givem the lack of sleep being in hospital then coming into the afternoon cold, surviving was more than enough!

## Day 2:

### Goals for today

**Spend a bit more time with Dash to complete yesterdays work**
As I had to finish early, we're going to revisit the afternoon challenge and try and complete a few more steps ahead of the afternoon.  I will measure this just by the amount of time we spend (plan is 45 mins to an hour)

**Start watching takeaway exemplar**
I believe it's a 90 minute video, so if I can spend 25 mins each day I will have watched it by the end of the week, so to measure success today, I want to have watched first 25 mins at least

### Summary

In the morning we had an intro to HTTP process modelling, then I spent 30 mins with Dash to make up for the lost time from yesterday and then pair coding with Peter

### General Notes:

Process modelling for HTTP seems far more binary - there's less interpretation/freedom than their is for defining classes etc.  But I think I prefer that!  Was a good session.  Then Dash and I cleared off a few more steps on the daily challenge before I paired with Peter.  Had a good session and have started work on the actual Battle application after an intro to how Sinatra and capybara works.

### Did I have fun?

Yes - it's fun learning new things which definitely this week has been doing

### Am I a better programmer?

Yes, learnt some starting tips on creating and testing web sites, using capybara and Sinatra.  Also the modelling session was good to help us work out how we're going to create them

### What do I want to do tomorrow?

* Watch another 25 mins of the exemplar
* After watching the start of the emeplar, maybe go back and find some exercises on Doubling - I understand the idea, but some of what I saw opened my eyes to more you can do with them!

### Have I completed today's goals?

Yes
